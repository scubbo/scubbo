# Professional History

After graduating with a degree in Mathematics and spending a year with a small web development company, I worked for 10 years with Amazon - 4 with Amazon Video in London, and 6 with Amazon Music in San Francisco, ending up as the Tech Lead for the Music Metrics and Data Platform organization. Upon recognizing the inevitable incipient burnout, I took 6 months off of work to recuperate. Since I'd been interested in resiliency and quality development practices while at Amazon (in my spare time I wrote the first version of what eventually became Amazon's Load Test coordination tool, and I led the Incident Analysis group in Music alongside my day job), I've moved into an SRE role at LegalZoom as of January 2023.

# Personal Work

I run a homelab as a testbed for tinkering and learning, mostly with k8s-/GitOps-related tools. Currently I'm trying to figure out how to [Crossplane](http://crossplane.io/)-ify All The Things.

I blog about technology and other things [here](https://blog.scubbo.org). The majority of my own code lives on my [personal Gitea instance](https://gitea.scubbo.org/) rather than on GitHub itself - this account is just for collaborating with others.

# Contact and Socials

[Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@scubbo) is my main Social Media app nowadays. I'm reachable via email at `me@scubbo.org`.
